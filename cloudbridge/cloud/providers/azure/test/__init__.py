Use ``python setup.py test`` to run these unit tests (alternatively, use
``python -m unittest test``).

You must set the CB_TEST_PROVIDER environment variable before running the
tests. Otherwise, the test suite will default to running against the mock
aws provider. Alternatively, use tox, which will run tests for all available
provider combinations.
