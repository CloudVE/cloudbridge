        Returns a list of objects up to a maximum limit.

        If a limit and marker are specified, the records will be fetched up to
        the limit starting from the marker onwards. The returned list is a list
        of class ResultList, which has extra properties like is_truncated,
        supports_total and total_records to provide extra information
        about record availability.

        If limit is not specified, the limit will default to the underlying
        provider's default limit. Therefore, you need to check the is_truncated
        property to determine whether more records are available.

        The total number of results can be determined through the total_results
        property. Not all provides will support returning the total_results
        property, so the supports_total property can be used to determine
        whether a total is supported.

        To iterate through all the records, it will be easier to iterate
        directly through the instances using __iter__ instead of calling
        the list method. The __iter__ method will automatically call the list
        method to fetch a batch of records at a time.

        .. code-block:: python
