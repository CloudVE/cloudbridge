        The name property is typically a user-friendly id value for the
        resource. The name is different from the id property in the following
        ways:

         1. The name property is often a more user-friendly value to
            display to the user than the id property.
         2. The name may sometimes be the same as the id, but should never
            be used in place of the id.
         3. The id is what will uniquely identify a resource, and will be used
            internally by CloudBridge for all get operations etc.
         4. All resources have a name.
         5. The name is read-only.
         6. However, the name may not necessarily be unique, which is the
            reason why it should not be used for uniquely identifying a
            resource.

        Example:
        The AWS machine image name maps to a CloudBridge name. It is not
        editable and is a user friendly name such as 'Ubuntu 18.04' and
        corresponds to the ami-name. It is distinct from the ami-id, which
        maps to CloudBridge's id property. The ami-name cannot be edited, and
        is set at creation time. It is not necessarily unique.
        In Azure, the machine image's name corresponds to CloudBridge's name
        property. In Azure, it also happens to be the same as the id property.

        The name property and the label property share the same character
        restrictions. See :py:attr:`~LabeledCloudResource.label`.

        If limit is not specified, the limit will default to the underlying

        The total number of results can be determined through the total_results

        whether a total is supported.

        To iterate through all the records, it will be easier to iterate
