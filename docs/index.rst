Welcome to CloudBridge's documentation!
=======================================

CloudBridge aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over
different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write
conditional code for each cloud.

Usage example
-------------

The simplest possible example for doing something useful with CloudBridge would
look like the following.

.. code-block:: python

	from cloudbridge.factory import CloudProviderFactory, ProviderList

	provider = CloudProviderFactory().create_provider(ProviderList.AWS, {})
	print(provider.compute.instances.list())

In the example above, the AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY environment variables
must be set to your cloud credentials.

Quick Reference
---------------

The following object graph shows how to access various provider services, and the resource
that they return. Click on any object to drill down into its details.

options, see the `installation page <topics/install.html>`_::
